# DESIGN — The Architect Loop v2

**A research-backed design for a Claude Code harness skill in which Claude Fable 5
(high effort) acts as architect/orchestrator and GPT-5.5 via Codex CLI (xhigh
reasoning) acts as builder, with the repo as the only memory.**

Researched June 2026 from Anthropic engineering posts, the official Fable 5 and
Codex CLI documentation, and the most-used community harness skills. Every
prescription below cites its source. This document is the "why"; the skill files
in `skills/architect/` are the "how".

---

## 1. The problem this design solves

Single-agent coding sessions degrade in three predictable ways:

1. **Context rot** — performance falls as the window fills; Anthropic calls the
   context window "a finite attention budget with diminishing returns"
   ([Effective Context Engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents)),
   and practitioners report a "dumb zone" past ~40% utilization
   ([HumanLayer ACE-FCA](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents)).
2. **Self-grading** — the agent that wrote the code reports its own success.
   Benchmark studies found 47–74% of self-improvement runs showed proxy gains
   without real gains, with agents escalating from overt to obfuscated reward
   hacks ([OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ikrQWGgxYg),
   [arXiv:2503.11926](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11926)).
3. **Goalpost drift** — acceptance criteria written (or edited) after results
   exist always pass.

The fix that every serious source converged on independently — Anthropic's
[harness design post](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps),
obra/superpowers' subagent-driven development, the Ralph loop, GitHub Spec Kit —
is the same shape:

> **Separate planning context from execution context. Persist state in the repo,
> not the conversation. Dispatch fresh-context workers per task. Verify with an
> agent that didn't write the code.**

This loop adds one more separation on top: **cross-vendor judgment**. The builder
and the judge are different models from different labs, which removes same-model
sycophancy bias from review ([OpenAI's own pitch for the Codex↔Claude
bridge](https://www.mindstudio.ai/blog/openai-codex-plugin-claude-code-cross-provider-review))
and lets each model do what it measurably does best: GPT-5.5 leads Terminal-Bench
2.0 (82.7%) for hands-on building; Fable 5 is Anthropic's strongest long-horizon
judgment model, with ~3× gains on complex tasks when paired with persistent
file-based memory ([Fable 5 announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-fable-5-mythos-5)).

The economics also work: judgment minutes on the expensive model, typing hours on
the flat-rate one. Community measurements of orchestrator/worker splits report
58–74% cost savings versus running the top model end-to-end
([Fable 5 Orchestrator Playbook](https://www.developersdigest.tech/blog/fable-5-orchestrator-model-playbook)).

## 2. Roles

| Role | Who | Effort | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Architect** | Claude Fable 5 in Claude Code (`effort: high` via skill frontmatter) | minutes per work block | arbitration, judging raw evidence against frozen gates, next-slice specs, kill/continue calls |
| **Builder** | GPT-5.5 via `codex exec` (`model_reasoning_effort: xhigh` default; architect may dial per slice) | hours per slice | implementation, lane agents, raw-results reporting |
| **Memory** | the repo: `docs/HANDOFF.md`, `docs/gates/`, git history | permanent | everything; not in the repo = didn't happen |
| **Human** | you | final | scope, irreversible calls, taste |

Why `high` for the architect: Fable 5's docs recommend `high` as the default and
`xhigh` for capability-sensitive work; low effort on Fable 5 already exceeds
xhigh on prior models ([Prompting Fable 5](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-fable-5)).
Judgment over a small handoff file is squarely in `high` territory; the skill
pins it with the `effort:` frontmatter key so it doesn't depend on session
settings.

Why `xhigh` for the builder: OpenAI's GPT-5.5 evals ran at xhigh, and independent
effort-curve data shows xhigh winning on the metrics that matter for unattended
work — semantic equivalence to the human PR (88% vs 69% at high) and
review-pass rate (69% vs 38%) — at ~2.2× the cost of high
([stet.sh effort curve](https://www.stet.sh/blog/gpt-55-codex-graphql-reasoning-curve)).
Since the builder runs unattended for hours, review-survival is the metric to
buy. The architect downgrades to `high` for routine, well-specified slices where
the data shows high is equal on test-pass — this is a per-slice judgment call
the spec records explicitly.

---

## 3. The twelve design rules

Each rule below is enforced mechanically by the skill, not left to vibes.

### R1. Repo docs are the memory; not in `HANDOFF.md` = didn't happen
Anthropic's long-running-agent harnesses use a progress file + git history as
the cross-session memory and find "compaction alone is insufficient — structural
artifacts are the load-bearing memory"
([Effective Harnesses](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)).
The architect refuses to judge results that exist only in chat output.
Community handoff conventions apply: the next session must grok the handoff in
under a minute; TL;DR first; exact paths/commands over prose
([handoff-memory conventions](https://lobehub.com/skills/neversight-learn-skills.dev-handoff-memory)).

### R2. Gates freeze before results exist, and live where the builder can't move them
Anthropic's three-agent harness has the generator and evaluator "negotiate a
sprint contract" in shared files **before coding**, then freeze it
([Harness Design](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps)).
The reward-hacking literature adds the mechanical requirement: keep graders and
criteria out of the agent's editable blast radius. Implementation: gates are
written to `docs/gates/<slice>.md` before dispatch, committed, and the
architect's post-run verification step includes `git diff` on `docs/gates/` —
**any builder edit to a gate file is an automatic slice FAIL**, regardless of
results. Criteria are quoted verbatim when judging, never restated from memory.

### R3. The builder never grades its own work — and neither does the architect alone
Two-stage review, fresh contexts, is the most-replicated community pattern
(superpowers' spec-compliance review then quality review;
[superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)). Anthropic's Fable 5 guide
states it directly: "Separate, fresh-context verifier subagents tend to
outperform self-critique." The loop's review stack:
1. Builder's own reviewer lane (inside Codex, never writes feature code) — cheap first pass.
2. Architect runs the gates **itself** and reads the output — "subagent test
   claims are hearsay" (your `/orchestrator` rule, matching Anthropic's
   "demand evidence, not assertions").
3. Cross-model adversarial pass for high-stakes slices: `codex review --base
   <branch>` (GPT reviewing its own lane output against the spec is still a
   different context; or a fresh Claude subagent red-teams the diff). Calibrate
   the reviewer: *"flag only correctness/requirement/invariant gaps with
   file:line evidence — no style preferences"* — an uncalibrated reviewer
   always finds something and that spirals into gold-plating.

### R4. Grade the outcome, not the path
From Anthropic's evals guidance: rigid step-sequence grading is brittle; judge
each gate as an independent dimension; give the judge an "unknown/INVALID"
escape so unmeasured ≠ passed
([Demystifying Evals](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents)).
Verdicts are per-gate: **PASS / FAIL / INVALID** (INVALID = not measured the way
the gate specifies), then a slice-level **kill / continue** call.

### R5. Disagreement is mandatory, with citations
The builder's PHASE 0 must surface every disagreement with the spec, citing real
files; silent compliance is a defect the architect flags. This is the loop's
defense against spec errors compounding — and it matches GPT-5.5's profile:
prescriptive specs are followed literally, so the only place errors get caught
is before execution. Every open disagreement gets an explicit
**ACCEPT / REJECT / MODIFY + one line why**. No deferrals.

### R6. Delegation carries the full contract: objective, output format, tool guidance, boundaries
Anthropic's multi-agent research system found vague delegation causes
duplication and misinterpretation; every dispatch needs those four parts
([Multi-Agent Research System](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system)).
The slice spec is exactly those four parts plus the frozen gates. Specs are
self-contained — the builder gets everything in the dispatch block, with repo
paths to read for detail (just-in-time retrieval, not context-stuffing). Per
OpenAI's prompting guidance, the full task spec goes up front in one
well-specified turn — ambiguous progressive specification degrades both token
efficiency and performance.

### R7. One slice per loop iteration; fresh builder context per slice
The Ralph loop's core lesson — and its author's explicit warning about
skill-ifying it: "if you implement Ralph as a skill inside the harness, you're
missing the point — the point is the always-fresh context"
([ghuntley.com/ralph](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/),
[HumanLayer's history](https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/brief-history-of-ralph)).
This skill respects that: the architect's context holds judgment only; every
slice is a **fresh `codex exec` process**. `codex exec resume --last` is used
only for follow-ups within the same slice (answering the builder's PHASE 0
questions), never to stretch one builder context across slices. "Code is cheap":
when a long run leaves the repo broken, `git reset` and re-dispatch beats rescue
prompting.

### R8. Parallel lanes only on disjoint file sets, capped at 3–4
Merge conflicts between parallel agents are the top reported multi-agent failure;
the converged mitigation is mapping file-touch sets before parallelizing, one
worktree per lane, and a practical ceiling of 2–4 lanes before coordination
overhead dominates ([Intility engineering](https://engineering.intility.com/article/agent-teams-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-about-merge-conflicts-and-love-git-worktrees),
[MindStudio worktrees](https://www.mindstudio.ai/blog/git-worktrees-parallel-ai-coding-agents)).
The builder block instructs max 3–4 lane agents on modules that don't import
each other, plus one reviewer lane. Codex's own multi-agent support
(`[features] multi_agent = true`, `~/.codex/agents/*.toml`) handles the
spawning; the spec defines the lane boundaries.

### R9. Supervise asynchronously; never block on the builder
Fable 5 is specifically tuned for this: "significantly more dependable at
dispatching and sustaining parallel subagents… prefer async communication over
blocking on each return" ([Prompting Fable 5](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-fable-5)).
The dispatch runs `codex exec` in the background; the architect ends its turn or
does other judgment work, then runs the post-flight checks when the run
completes. Multi-hour builder runs are normal (community reports: 6.5h runs at
~20% of a weekly Codex quota).

### R10. Grounded progress claims — audit every status against tool output
Fable 5 guidance: instruct the model to audit every status claim against a tool
result from the session before reporting; in Anthropic's testing this "nearly
eliminated fabricated status reports." Applied twice here: the architect's own
reports, and the handoff rules for the builder (raw tables/numbers/SHAs only —
"no interpretation, no 'promising'; verdicts belong to the architect and the
human").

### R11. Ground before judging; scale effort to the task
Carried over from your `/orchestrator` skill, and matching Claude Code best
practices: read the project's own operating docs (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md → README →
architecture docs) and learn its verification gate before any judgment; a wrong
assumption multiplies through every dispatch. And not everything needs the loop:
trivial work gets done directly; the full pipeline is for slice-sized work and
up. "Every component in a harness encodes an assumption about what the model
can't do on its own" — don't run a $200 harness on a $9 task
([Harness Design](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps)).

### R12. Keep the skill thin, declarative, and prunable
Two reasons. (a) Claude Code skill mechanics: only descriptions sit in context
until invoked, but the body stays in context for the session — keep it terse,
push detail to referenced files ([Skills docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)).
(b) Obsolescence: "skills developed for prior models are often too prescriptive
for Claude Fable 5 and can degrade output quality" (Fable 5 guide), and the
Claude Code team's own position is that scaffolds get obsoleted by better models
([Latent Space, harness engineering](https://www.latent.space/p/harness-eng)).
The skill states *invariants* (the rules above) and *interfaces* (the dispatch
contract), not step-by-step micro-procedures. Review it against each new model
generation and delete what the model now does unprompted.

---

## 4. The builder interface (verified against Codex CLI ≥ 0.133, June 2026)

Facts the skill encodes — several correct widespread misinformation:

- **Model slug is `gpt-5.5`**, not `gpt-5.5-codex`; the `-codex`-suffixed line
  ended at gpt-5.3 and is deprecated under ChatGPT sign-in. Pin it explicitly —
  automations have been reported silently defaulting to older models.
- **`--full-auto` is deprecated.** The current unattended invocation is
  `--sandbox workspace-write -a never`.
- **Effort** is `-c model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"` (or `high`), per invocation.
- **Structured telemetry**: `--json` (JSONL event stream) and
  `-o <file>` / `--output-last-message` for the final message;
  `--output-schema <schema.json>` can force the builder's final report to
  conform to a JSON schema — used for the machine-checkable run report.
- **Session continuity**: `codex exec resume --last "<follow-up>"` for
  same-slice follow-ups.
- **Goal Mode** (`/goal`) is interactive-TUI; GA and default since v0.133.0
  (May 2026). Real subcommands: bare `/goal`, `/goal pause|resume|clear`. For
  headless dispatch, `codex exec` already loops until done — Goal Mode is the
  manual-mode equivalent when you babysit a run yourself.
- **`AGENTS.md`** is the builder's standing context (concatenated root-down,
  deeper files override). The loop's PHASE rules live in the dispatch block, not
  AGENTS.md, so they version with the skill; repo-specific build/test commands
  belong in AGENTS.md per OpenAI's guidance.
- **`codex review --base <branch>`** gives an independent reviewer context for
  the cross-model review gate.

Canonical dispatch:

```bash
codex exec -C <repo> --sandbox workspace-write -a never \
  -m gpt-5.5 -c model_reasoning_effort="xhigh" \
  --json -o .architect/last-run.md \
  "<builder block: PHASE rules + slice spec + frozen gate references>"
```

Subscription note: ChatGPT-plan quotas are per-5-hour window plus a weekly cap;
long runs draw on the weekly pool. For unattended overnight loops that must not
die mid-run, `CODEX_API_KEY` per-token billing avoids window exhaustion — the
architect notes this trade-off but defaults to the subscription.

## 5. The loop, end to end

```
┌──────────────────────────── one work block ────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                            │
│  /architect                                                                │
│   0. Ground: CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md → verification gate → docs/HANDOFF.md     │
│   1. Arbitrate: every open disagreement → ACCEPT/REJECT/MODIFY + why       │
│   2. Judge: run gates yourself; verdict per gate vs verbatim frozen text   │
│      PASS / FAIL / INVALID → kill / continue                               │
│   3. Spec next slice: objective + output format + tool guidance +          │
│      boundaries + out-of-scope; freeze gates to docs/gates/<slice>.md;     │
│      commit the freeze                                                     │
│   4. Dispatch: codex exec (background, fresh context, xhigh default)       │
│      PHASE 0 disagree-or-fail → PHASE 1 freeze contracts →                 │
│      PHASE 2 ≤3-4 disjoint lanes + 1 reviewer lane → commit/push →         │
│      update HANDOFF.md with raw results only                               │
│   5. Post-flight: HANDOFF updated? disagreements raised? git diff on       │
│      docs/gates/ clean? → report; judgment waits for next block            │
│                                                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         repo carries everything across the gap between blocks
```

The human reads the handoff between blocks and overrides anything. Architect
verdicts on a slice always happen in a **later** architect session than the one
that dispatched it — the dispatcher never grades the run it launched in the same
breath (fresh-context judgment, R3).

### Optional pre-spec research fan-out

Between judging and speccing, the architect may run a research phase: 3–5
parallel `codex exec --sandbox read-only --search` web-research subagents, each
answering one narrow non-overlapping question, with the architect adversarially
verifying load-bearing claims and writing `docs/prd/<slice>.md` itself. Design
decisions behind it:

- **Trigger-gated, not always-on.** "Research if you think it helps" either
  fires constantly or never; instead the skill names three concrete triggers
  (slice depends on external APIs/libraries/versions new to the repo; a
  technology choice needs facts nobody has; the human asks) and defaults to
  skip — the builder's verify-against-reality requirement already covers
  routine API checks (R11: scale effort to the task).
- **Progressive disclosure.** The mechanics live in `research.md`, read only
  when a trigger fires — the default architect context never pays for them
  (R12, per [Skills docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) guidance to
  push detail to referenced files).
- **Codex researchers, Fable judgment.** Research is coverage work — it runs
  at `high` effort on the flat-rate OpenAI sub, read-only sandboxed with live
  search ([CLI features](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/features);
  `[tools.web_search] allowed_domains` available as prompt-injection defence).
  Verification of load-bearing claims and PRD authorship stay with the
  architect — researchers are explicitly forbidden from making
  recommendations, the research-side equivalent of "raw results only" (R3).
- **Findings discipline** mirrors deep-research harnesses: every finding
  carries a URL, date, exact quote/figure, and confidence tag; disagreements
  between sources are reported, not resolved; "NOT FOUND" beats inference.
  Multi-angle decomposition (docs / changelogs / failure reports /
  alternatives) follows the multi-modal-sweep pattern from
  [Anthropic's multi-agent research system](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system).
- **The PRD is repo memory; raw findings are not.** `docs/prd/<slice>.md` is
  committed with citations (R1); raw researcher output stays in the gitignored
  `.architect/research/`. The builder's PHASE 0 challenges the PRD like any
  other spec input.

---

## 6. Failure modes → mechanical mitigations

| Failure mode | Mitigation in this design |
|---|---|
| Reward hacking / gate tampering | Gates committed pre-dispatch in `docs/gates/`; post-flight `git diff` check; tampering = automatic FAIL (R2) |
| Builder grades own work | Raw-results-only handoff; architect runs gates itself; cross-model review (R3, R10) |
| Goalpost moving | Verbatim gate quoting; gates never edited after results; missing gate = spec defect, frozen for next slice only (R2, R4) |
| Scope creep | Explicit out-of-scope list per slice; silent scope additions = builder failure; architect flags creep by name (R5, R6) |
| Context rot | Architect context holds judgment only; fresh builder process per slice; repo is the memory (R1, R7) |
| Merge conflicts between lanes | Disjoint-file-set lanes, ≤3–4, worktrees, one reviewer lane gating merges (R8) |
| Placeholder implementations | Gate commands are end-to-end and executable; "search before implementing; no placeholder code" in the builder block (R4) |
| Broken repo after a long run | One slice per iteration; commit per lane; `git reset` + re-dispatch over rescue prompting (R7) |
| Fabricated status reports | Every status claim audited against a tool result, both sides (R10) |
| Harness bloat / obsolescence | Thin declarative skill; per-model-generation pruning review (R12) |

---

## 7. What this deliberately is not

- **Not a general-purpose orchestrator.** Your `/orchestrator` skill covers
  single-model plan→delegate→review inside Claude Code. This skill is the
  cross-vendor loop; it imports `/orchestrator`'s grounding, delegation-contract,
  and verify-it-yourself rules rather than duplicating the whole pipeline.
- **Not an autonomous infinite loop.** The human sits between work blocks by
  design — that's where kill/continue authority lives. If you want unattended
  multi-block runs, the dispatch step composes with `claude -p` / scheduled
  jobs, but that's an extension, not the default (and note `claude -p` draws on
  separate Agent SDK credits from June 15, 2026).
- **Not Goal-Mode-in-a-trenchcoat.** Codex's Goal Mode already loops
  plan→act→test→review against a stopping condition. This design's value-add is
  everything Goal Mode can't do: cross-model judgment, frozen external gates,
  arbitration, and repo-resident memory across runs.
